<p>I am still without a job and as a result of this I get ob offerings by companies via Xing and Linkedin. Some of them are not making me very happy. One of the was going like this:</p>

<p>I have received job offers like this around 4 times since I am looking for a new position. From companies providing snooping equipment for 3rd world states to manufacturers of non-lethal weapons to big companies from the "aerospace" industry (building shit from snooping equipment to laser guided bombs). These offerings make me angry. Why the hell do these people think I would be as foolish to trade my knowledge and time in exchange for money and know all this is used to further help the companies that profit simply killing other human.</p>
<p>I deeply believe in a certain responsibility that every living person has and a choice that comes with being alive. And one choice out there I will never take</p>
