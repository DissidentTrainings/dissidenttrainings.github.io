<p>This week was code, code and code.</p>
<p>If you look for a way to generate a appcache.manifest and make your page more available for offline usage, <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-appcache">grunt-appcache</a> is your friend.</p>
<p><a href="http://manifesto.ericdelabar.com/">Manifesto</a> is a anice bookmarklet to let you check HTML appcache manifests.</p>
<p>Using input fields with an TabletPC might pose ne challenges to event handling as I found out. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2593139/ipad-web-app-detect-virtual-keyboard-using-javascript-in-safari">Dismissing the virtual keyboard might break your layout.</a></p>
<p>Instead of using backbone and wondering about the amount of boilerplate to write, I might have a look into the new <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/apper">apper</a> framework for single page apps. Nice one.</p>
<p><a href="http://mathjs.org/history.html">Math.js just got a 1.0 </a>and I find the new filter feature very interesting. You might wanna check your js codebase for calculations that could be done with mathjs in a simpler way. Still I heavily recommend it.</p>
