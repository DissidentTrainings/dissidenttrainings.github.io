<p>I will be moving some of the posts from here to a new site that will host dissident trainings and all workshop related stuff.</p>
<p>If someone has ideas on the final <a href="https://github.com/DissidentTrainings/site">jekyll</a> site or a way to move posts from wordpress.com to a new blog (my seo friends): <strong>please send me ideas and hints</strong>.</p>
<p>The posts that will be moved get a tag: '<strong><em>dissent</em>'</strong></p>
