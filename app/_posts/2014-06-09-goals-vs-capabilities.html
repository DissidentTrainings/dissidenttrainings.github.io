    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nEvery project worth doing has a vision, and someone
    who's championed that vision and fought for the budget. That person is the primary
    stakeholder. (This person is the real product owner; anyone else is just a proxy
    with a title.)\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the vision, a bunch of other stakeholders
    have <em>goals</em> which have to be met. For instance:\r\n<ul>\n<li>The moderator
    of the site wants to stop bots spamming the site.</li>\r\n\t<li>The architect
    wants the system to be maintainable and extensible.</li>\r\n\t<li>The users want
    to know how to use the system.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese goals are tied in with the
    stakeholder's roles. They don't change from project to project, though they might
    change from job to job, or when the stakeholder changes roles internally.\r\n\r\nWithin
    a project, we deliver the stakeholder's goals by providing people and the system
    with different <em>capabilities</em>. The capabilities show us <em>how</em> we
    will achieve the goals within the scope of a particular project, but aren't concrete;
    it still doesn't matter <em>how</em> we achieve the capabilities. The word \"capability\"
    means to be able to do something really well.\r\n<ul>\n<li>The system will be
    able to tell whether users are humans or bots.</li>\r\n\t<li>Developers will be
    able to replace any part of the system easily.</li>\r\n\t<li>Users will be able
    to read documentation for each new screen.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOften we end up jumping
    straight from the goals to the features which implement the capabilities. I think
    it's worth backtracking to remember what capability we're delivering, because
    it helps us work out if there's any other way to implement it.\r\n<ul>\n<li>We're
    creating this captcha box because we need to tell if humans are users or bots.
    Or we could just make them sign in via their Twitter account...</li>\r\n\t<li>We're
    adding this adapter because we want to be able to replace the persistence layer
    if we need to. Or we could just use microservices and replace the whole thing...</li>\r\n\t<li>We're
    writing documentation in the week before we go live. Or we could just generate
    it from the blurb in the automated scenarios...</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBy <em>chunking
    up</em> from the features to the capabilities, we can give ourselves more options.
    Options have value!\r\n\r\nBut <em>chunking down</em> from goals to capabilities
    is also useful. The goals for a stakeholder's role don't tend to change, but neither
    do the capabilities for the project, which makes them <a href=\"http://lizkeogh.com/2013/09/05/capability-based-planning-and-lightweight-analysis/\">nice-sized
    chunks for planning purposes</a>.\r\n\r\nFeatures, which implement the capabilities,
    change all the time, <a href=\"lizkeogh.com/2013/07/21/estimating-complexity/\">especially
    if the capabilities are new</a>. And stories are just a slice through a feature
    to get quick feedback on whether we're delivering the capability or not (or understanding
    it well, or not!).\r\n\r\nBe careful with the word <em>epic</em>, which I've found
    tends to refer indiscriminately to goals, capabilities, features or just slices
    through features which are a bit too big to get feedback on (big stories). The
    Odyssey is an epic. What you have is something different.</div>\";}"
