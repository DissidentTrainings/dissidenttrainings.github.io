<p>The Flow-State concept made me think more about the way we work. Especially the concept of Group-Flow was inspiring:</p>
<p><em>Csíkszentmihályi suggests several ways a group can work together so that each individual member achieves flow. The characteristics of such a group include:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Creative spatial arrangements: Chairs, pin walls, charts, but no tables; thus work primarily standing and moving</em></li>
<li><em>Playground design: Charts for information inputs, flow graphs, project summary, craziness (here also craziness has a place), safe place (here all may say what is otherwise only thought), result wall, open topics</em></li>
<li><em>Parallel, organized working</em></li>
<li><em>Target group focus</em></li>
<li><em>Advancement of existing one (prototyping)</em></li>
<li><em>Increase in efficiency through visualization</em></li>
<li><em>Using differences among participants as an opportunity, rather than an obstacle</em></li>
</ul>
