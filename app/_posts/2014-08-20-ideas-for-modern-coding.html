<p>If starting a new web project follow some basic principles</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with deploy code - It must be deployable from moment 0</li>
<li>Use Unit- and Functionaltests</li>
<li>The deployed code is testable and thereby you can verify it</li>
<li>Use Virtual machines to recreate the live environment</li>
<li>All is in GIT - dev and ops code</li>
<li>Use cont. integration and cont. deployment from moment 0</li>
<li>Static analyze the code - it's cheap</li>
<li>Build in monitoring and logging</li>
<li>Whatever you do, write some docs, build them automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I will try this. Using this one would end up with a recreatable environment, that 5 years later, everyone who wants to use the software, can recreate. It's not ma a magic bullet, but I think it could speed up a lot of things heavily.</p>
<p>A day setup can save you a lot of worries. The less you depend on things made "by hand" and if you put something aside for a while, you will be able to return easily.</p>
