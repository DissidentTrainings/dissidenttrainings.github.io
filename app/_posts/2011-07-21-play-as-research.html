<p>The creation of games is particularly well-suited to provide a model of research through design. In this book’s introduction, Brenda Laurel makes a distinction between the notion of designing “for needs” and designing “for delight.” {see Laurel , Introduction}While all forms of design partake of both of these categories in some measure, game design is particularly skewed toward the creation of delightful experience, rather then the fulfillment of utilitarian needs. Although it is true that we can create and play games for a particular function (for exercise, to meet people, to learn about a topic), by and large, games are played for the intrinsic pleasures they provide.</p>
