<p>I hear a lot of teams are <a href="https://twitter.com/superfizzle/status/398471337490276352">"POST-SCRUM"</a>. That is not a bad thing, given one of the basic mechanics is <a href="http://marcbless.blogspot.de/2011/05/agile-principle-12-inspect-and-adapt.html">"Inspect and Adapt"</a>. This is constantly changing the process and it's properties from sprint to sprint. So, basically you go "POST-SCRUM" after Sprint One (most times it's the third in practice).</p>
<p>However, you want to take the principles in the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">agile manifesto</a> into consideration and check if your changes collide with them For further reference, I added them here</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Build projects around motivated individuals. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Agile processes promote sustainable development. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</strong></li>
<li><strong>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I don't really care what you do. Really. No matter if you go for Scrum-Ban, Pure Kanban or join the #noestimates movement. These principles can help you to check your "POST-SCRUM" setup. Don't go post beyond them without serious reasoning.</p>
<p>p.s. Don't fall for marketing people. Scrum bashed waterfall for marketing reasons (and Crystal Clear, RUP for that matter) and was very successful with it. Yes, I am guilty as charged as well. We could get out of this cycle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme#Memetic_lifecycle:_Transmission.2C_retention">adversative memes</a>, out there to sell you the next method (and certificates, workshops that come with the new hot shit).</p>
