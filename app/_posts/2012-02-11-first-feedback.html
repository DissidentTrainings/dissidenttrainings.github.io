<p>It looks like some people found the journeyman's travel idea appealing (800 Reads in 3 days, 5 proposals for journeyman's destinations) and  gave me some feedback. It looks like that workshops seem to be a main interest of people contacting me.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I added a github repo with a <a href="https://github.com/sebs/journeymans/wiki">wiki</a> in order to document stuff. I decided the documentation about how the workshop is constructed and some background info wont hurt. As a sideffect there might be stuff other people might want for their workshops.</p>
