<p>Back then I  had some discussions about agreed upon rules I wanted the team  to follow (me was coaching) with a manager.  In that situation the manager wanted to do things that were against<em> the rules</em> or simply breaking them. It seemed more easy that way for him, the rules felt to strict in that situation. He told me the following metaphor:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"You know, when you are at a traffic light at night, it's red, in a small street with no traffic,  and no one is around. Would you stop there for the red light phase?"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously he was pointing out that sticking to the agreed  ruleset in situations where they "obviously" are not making sense is stupid or a waste of time.</p>

<p>I am sorry, especially the red traffic light metaphor is a bad guidance. According to <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu%C3%9Fverkehr">wikipedia</a> (sorry the german one):</p>
<blockquote><p>one fifth of all fatal accidents (remark: pedestrians) occurs after ignoring a red light or disregarding the primacy order.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is, according to the same wikipedia page, 108 dead  people (Austrian stats ) and we should take into consideration that these are, to a greater extend as in accidents with only cars involved, kids and old people.</p>
<p>So next time you break/change a rule in your agile team, think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does every role involved know it?
<ul>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Product Owner</li>
<li>Manager</li>
<li>Customer</li>
<li>Scrum Master</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Was there time to adopt the rule?</li>
<li>Was there time to give some feedback?</li>
<li>Did you consider to change the rule at a Sprint End/Start?</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog post might not be very consistent, but the topic bugs me for some times. So please be patient: I shot this from the hip. And now you can burn me in the comments for being a "dictator" with the "rules" but thinking of 108 (Austrian) kids who could still be alive if everyone involved sticked to the agreed rules would make me halt at night at a traffic light where no one is around and wait for the sprint end to fix the rules when everyone can notice. It's just 2 weeks (sprint) or 2 minutes (red light) that make the difference .....</p>
