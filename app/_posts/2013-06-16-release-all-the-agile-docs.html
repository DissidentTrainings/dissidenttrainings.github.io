<p><a href="http://sebsonconferences.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/38801650.jpg"><img class=" wp-image alignleft" id="i-408" alt="Image" src="assets/38801650.jpg?w=290" width="261" height="261" /></a>There are a lot of helpers and tools that get created by teams engaging in agile software development. I work on materials like this as well. Actually there is a lot of stuff out there that you can use. I think a mayor example is the tasty cupcakes website.</p>
<p>However, if I want to create a professional training and need to come up with some materials, I need to create everything for myself or license it. To be honest, the process behind creating those materials is not only interesting and creative but also  time-consuming and expensive. Time-consuming is the creation of the contents/assets and versioning of all that.  Expensive are the assets e.g. stock photos.</p>
<p>Why not go the other way around? There are books, websites and materials all over the place. But in most cases I dont have the rights to use this in a commercial context. Let's create a complete set of materials, online with the right license. Complete and in it's pure form. Everyone should be entitled to use those in a commercial context, change them and republish it under a own name. Publish a book with it, build a website or in my case: create a training.</p>
<p><strong>The proposal </strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><i>For the users of agile methods</i></strong><br />
<strong><i>who dont have access to a complete set of training materials </i></strong><br />
<strong><i><a href="https://github.com/organizations/cc0agile" target="_blank">#cc0agile</a> is a content repository </i></strong><br />
<strong><i>that provides <a title="CC0" href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">CC0</a> licensed training materials, assets and further information  about agile softwaredevelopment methods</i></strong><br />
<strong><i></i></strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong><i>unlike existing websites, training materials and resources</i></strong><br />
<strong><i>all contents have no copyright strings attached</i><i> </i></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The following ideas flow around</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contents get published under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">CC0</a> license - everyone can use it with no strings attached</li>
<li>Use the #cc0agile hashtag in commits and twitter posts - create the repository</li>
<li>Use Github repositories for the original contents - content versioning, wiki, bugtracker</li>
<li>no central authority, the only rule is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">CC0</a> and sources -</li>
<li>Source Data - Give the user the maximum freedom to modify and remix contents</li>
<li>The content repo is the attribution, it reflects all the changes and authorship information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I created a github organization named <a href="https://github.com/organizations/cc0agile" target="_blank">cc0agile</a> being the hub for all information  that comes with the hashtag #cc0agile and a clear CC0 license text.</p>
<p>I would love to see some contributions from users, trainers, coaches and who ever is interested.</p>
<p><strong>CC0 license for ALL the agile training materials!s</strong></p>
