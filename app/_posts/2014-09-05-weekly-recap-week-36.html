<p>This week was full of interesting stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>COACHING: I had to do some research on feedback types and styles. I stumbled on this document<a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108019/chapters/Types-of-Feedback-and-Their-Purposes.aspx">, giving a little more background </a>on the special properties of feedback.</li>
<li>TRAINING: Another research task was on the basics of lean. I am hammering together a workshop on the Lean Basics and Kanban, so I needed <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/lean-for-dummies-cheat-sheet.html">all in one Place on this Cheatsheet</a>. I need to recreate this with CC.</li>
<li>FUNDING: I did choose a website Theme and took a deeper look into the Onepager from <a href="http://www.rebelatheartpr.com/">http://www.rebelatheartpr.com/</a> which will serve as a good example for structure and approach. ;) My <a href="http://gridgum.com/themes/gw-a-personal-bootstrap-theme/">theme of choice</a>.</li>
<li>CODING: If you do anything tech related to web and did not read the HTTP Status Codes RFC, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">I urge you to do so. It is !IMPORTANT</a></li>
<li>NEWS: Mytaxi was sold to Daimler. I am applauding the team + Nic Mewes and Sven Külper. A german startup dream come true I guess. That is something that other big german funders never did: Building something original, as one of the first movers, not cloning anything. <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/daimler-acquires-transportation-apps-ridescout-140054526.html">You better worship that</a> ;))))</li>
<li>CODING: A HTML/JS based editor. Smalleditor got my attention. I like how it is made. Definetly something to look into. <a style="font-size:13px;" href="https://github.com/jdkanani/smalleditor">https://github.com/jdkanani/smalleditor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of different things. Interesting times.</p>
