<p>@<a href="http://321heinz.tumblr.com/">321Heinz</a> presented me with a challenge:</p>
<p><em>For the last days you are remaining in this company you are required to approach one colleague only in a non violent way.</em></p>
<p>I extend this challenge to <strong>all</strong> colleagues and I am very keen to see the result, since the first attempts have been very successful.</p>
<p>So lets show some empathy and give it a try.</p>
