<p>A lot of materials need to be generated in order to organise a workshop on agile. Especially when you involve activities and do not do a frontal style powerpoint thingie. I did this the first time for the dutch PHP Conference and people really liked my new setup. A lot of Stuff is based on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn/dp/0787996629/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329204273&amp;sr=8-1">"Training from Back of the Room"</a> mixed up with my knowhow.</p>
<p>Since I am not a professional trainer/consultant,  I do not plan to open a own consultancy in the near future and had several experiences with Open Source Software as a developer and user, I came to the conclusion that re-sharing my ideas in a format that other can use to easily build workshops is more of an obligation than an option.</p>

<p>In order to make sure all my journeyman's travel work, that will contain workshop generation and design as well, gets around and is not wasted in just one woorkshop i decided to put up a <a href="https://github.com/sebs/journeymans/wiki/Pair-Programming-Workshop">wikipage</a> for the first workshop and license it under creative commons + attribution + derivates allowed + commercial use allowed. I hope this provides enough freedom for everybody to use the materials and concepts for themselves and maybe add a little something.</p>
<p>It is still work in progress, so bare with me with typos et al., but it totally represents the way I am putting these together when I am asked to do so for an professional environment.</p>
<p>Nuff said, except for a little hint what I want you to do with it</p>
