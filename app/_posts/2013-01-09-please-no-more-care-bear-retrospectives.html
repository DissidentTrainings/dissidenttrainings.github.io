<p>I was stumbling over an article that presented a way to hold a part of a special kind of retrospective:</p>
<p><a href="http://agile-retrospectives.com/post/39571763915/care-bear-retrospective"><b>The purpose of this retrospective is to get only positive cards!</b></a></p>
<p>The Basic Idea is to find a positive thing about the things that went bad during a sprint, and this in the phase where we try to gather data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask each team member to write cards with things that happened good during the sprint and things that went bad.</li>
<li>For each negative card, ask people to find a positive thing about it, and make it a new card</li>
<li>Ask people to present only positive cards!</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel alarmed and troubled when I hear this. This results out of my need of being authentic to people and let them have an autonomous decision on how they feel something went in a sprint/life/job whatever. As a result of this I expect openness and total/brutal honesty when it comes to naming the facts from the teams that enter a room for a retro with me.</p>
<p>I mean this is a pattern we see in parental-ship (<em>Oh little doggy pet died! don't cry, he is in doggy heaven now</em>) and even in modern communication methods where the hard facts of a "Story" (for example the Drone-war in Afghanistan/Pakistan) are understated to a level of degree that we don't get the real situation anymore (this is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis_(figure_of_speech)">Meiosis</a>). In full effect I would go as fas as calling it a variant of Orwell's "Newspeak". Quote from 1984:</p>
<p><b>"It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words."</b></p>
<p>We are neither a nation of suppressed people nor little children. There are so many natural safeguards and barriers that people have to overcome when they <b>have</b> to speak up in a retro that I do not want to risk this willingness by not allowing a certain way to take part in a this event.</p>
<p>Let's see what <a href="http://www.estherderby.com/">Esther Derby</a> has to say about the purpose of this 2nd phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a shared pool of data</li>
<li>ground the retrospective on facts, not opinion</li>
<li>consider the objective experience</li>
</ul>
<p>I find this already very hard to achieve and must admit I find the goals a little hard: Especially the <b>facts, not opinion</b> part. I don't go for it in every retrospective, especially not the Phase 2 ;). Why? The separation of <b>observations</b> and so called <b>facts</b> is a very hard thing. I tend to do a <a href="http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Mad,_Sad,_Glad">mad/sad/glad</a> after the team put some observations to the wall, most times in form of a <a href="http://tomhawes.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/retrospectivetimelinetrendssmall.jpg">timeline</a>. What happened when, free from judgements and so called facts. These facts are most times hard to dissect from opinion. Mad/Sad/Glad is based on Feelings aka can be pure opinion as well.</p>
<p>This <b>shared</b> thought thing contains the danger that only popular opinions will be accepted. This is not what I want from a retro. I want disagreement, discussion and a group of people trying to work out one or two ideas on how things can be done better the next sprint.</p>
<p>It's just my opinion that care-bearing won't help. True, honest communication will. This is hard to do, we are constantly getting fed other types of communication, far from honest, most times not true.</p>
<p>My retrospective, my rules. So in case you are trapped in any of those events with me and think of something as negative, please say so, any moment with your words whatever they are.</p>
