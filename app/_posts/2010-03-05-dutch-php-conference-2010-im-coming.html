<p>This might look like another shameless self-advertising scheme, but my intention is a completely different one.</p>
<p>After submitting some talks and a tutorial to the CFP they said YES and invited me over to hold a fullday tutorial and a little talk. I would like to use thisÂ  Blog to share the ideas, slides and other materials. The preparation is anyway most of the time and why not share that and all I stumble over the time I prepare stuff. I hope to get one or another remark regarding the contents and topics.</p>

<h3>Scrum Workshop - Working projects the iterative way</h3>
<p>Scrum is a lightweight way of organizing and pulling of projects, focussing on the value of features and the regular event of estimation.</p>
<p>A predefined set of events and methods guides you through a iterative project development effort and makes always sure you get stuff delivered. The fullday workshop shows the basics, exercises planning poker and other educational games for the attendees. It's not a fullscale training with a certificate but it is a good introduction that will help you judge if scrum is good for you or not.</p>
<h3>Async webservices with php and nodejs</h3>
<p>PHP is a very nice language, but it's design has some shortcomings when it comes to a large number of http requests at the same time. Every access to a ressource, like for example a database or a filesystem makes your server wait for a result and blocks CPU cycles/RAM that could be used for other things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifecycle of a apache+php request for starters and why it's not perfect</li>
<li>Shortcomings of current php caching methods</li>
<li>The http Status code 202 Accepted</li>
<li>Nodejs architecture for starters</li>
<li>Implementation of a ajax proxy to a php webservice that will even work when under heavy load</li>
</ul>
<p>The nodejs webserver can fix this with it's asycronous way to handle requests and working with externals sources of data.</p>
