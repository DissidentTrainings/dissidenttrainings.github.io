<p>Yesterday night, before going out I got a little note in my Facebook Feed about a new anti-manifesto called <a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html">"Programming, Motherfucker - Do you speak it?" </a></p>
<p>Basically someone is tired of XP, Scrum et al. and now tries to embrace the core of our art: programming.</p>
<p>Quoting from the site:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">

<p><em>We think the shit on the left, is really just the con in the middle, and that we really need to just do the thing on the right...<strong>Programming, Motherfucker</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Sorry Zed A. Shaw, Fuck you!  Very dearly.</p>
<p>Looking at his page I had to discover that I am actively advertising especially the ".... the hard way" stuff from him to other people. But the guy seems to have a little social disability at least, looking at this "manifesto".</p>
<p><strong><em>We are a community of motherfucking programmers who have been humiliated by software development methodologies for years.</em></strong></p>
<p>You have been humiliated? And right so, I really do not give a fuck about you, for sure being highly paid and feeling humiliated by anyone. The damn job market is a sellers market. Go find a job where people care about you as a person, information technology  is THE area where you can do any job change. But if you feel like you have been humiliated, the place behind a computerkeyboard is the wrong one. There is no piece of code that can express your feelings and equest from people the threat you differently. No piece of code can express and fix this. It is individuals and interactions with them that can do it. You even can learn how to express the feeling of humiliation to others so that they understand your pain: Go learn non-violent communication, Motherfucker.</p>

<div><strong><em>We are tired of XP, Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, Software Craftsmanship(aka XP-Lite) and anything else getting in the way of...Programming, Motherfucker.</em></strong></div>
<div></div>
<p>Depending on language and the special case you are programming, the time spent on coding might account only for 15% of all time at hand. If you did not get it until today that planning and speaking to your colleagues is a central part of your work, especially as obviously very senior coder, I do not give a chickenshit about your skills as programmer. You failed your profession. Where do you think that young coder next door will get his skills from? Do you think you will be available all the time?</p>
<p>I am tired of guys like you, who have coding skills like a god but are not willing to share, because meetings are so tiring and not helping anybody as well as planning is not in your eyes. I need to tell you that in most cases it's people like you sitting in these meetings and making em toxic and wasteful, disturbing them by being passively and not participating because in the end you think it is YOU who is doing the job.</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to stick to a method, so that the other people working on that product can align to your work, fuck you Motherfucker. You have no respect for others, just for yourself and your little place behind the keyboard.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>We are tired of being told we're autistic idiots who need to be manipulated to work in a Forced Pair Programming chain gang without any time to be creative because none of the 10 managers on the project can do... Programming, Motherfucker.</strong></p>
<p>Why do you suspect people judging you as a autistic idiot? Do you feel like one? Who forced pairing on you? Do you know how NOT creative it is to code ideas instead of maybe going to a flipchart and thinking them through? Manipulation? Why do you feel manipulated? XP and Scrum require a lot of discipline in planning and programming, it might bring you out of your comfort zone, but this is where the brain works best. Especially when it is about creativity. Go into the research about how people are creative, or how the brain works. Your mid 90ies skillset will not give you any answers.</p>
<div></div>
<div>
<p><strong>We must destroy these methodologies that get in the way of...Programming, Motherfucker.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you are right. But with the goal to rebuild on the shoulders of giants and rise with something new and better. It seems you might be a person that could get us some ideas, but just telling everyone that everything is shit and hide behind your 24 inch monitor will not create anything better. It's just plain FUD, to be honest.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Tons of billable hours</strong></div>
<div></div>
<p>If you have a problem with billable hours, then go fuck off and quit your job to get hired by a company that does a product and eat your own dogfood day by day. Most times it's whiny "per hour" coders that wakeup in the reality of a company working on a product and you then realize you lost the ability NOT  to care about the crap you delivered to customers and leave the scene got lost. When you stay longer at a company, every bit and piece of broken crap produced will come back at you. Limiting the amount of money that can be made and putting your poor colleagues jobs at risk. I do that deliberately and believe me, it is far more out of the comfort zone than going to a client, deliver a project by billable hours and walk away when you are "done"</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Pointless tests</strong></div>
<div></div>
<p>If you havent got the sense and reason behind software testing, you are not a pro Motherfucker. There is a reason for a assert command in most programming languages.</p>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Bleeding clients dry</strong></div>
<div></div>
<p>Who are you working for? Guess that companies make good additions to my "better die than work with" list.</p>
<div><strong>Instability and plausible deniabilit</strong>y</div>
<div></div>
<p>You got a point here, seriously, I think this is the achilles heel of the agile manifesto. This is where you should be poking around a little more. The whole agile movement has a little blind spot there and these projects in "sustainable pace" turn motherfucking deathmarches.</p>
<p>A little pointless provocation delivered here, by nerds who think everything that comes with an insult is funny. Everyone who knows me is aware that I am guilty by the same charges G*. So I took my time to flame a little back at you <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">Zed. A. Shaw</a>, Motherfucker.</p>
