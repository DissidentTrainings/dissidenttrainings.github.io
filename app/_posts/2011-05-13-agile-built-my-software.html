<p>soon i discovered that this agile thing was true<br />
waterfall was the devil<br />
agile was a standard in humanity previous to it's career in the software industry<br />
all of a sudden, i found myself in love with the world<br />
so there was only one thing that i could do<br />
was ding a ding dang my dang a long ling long</p>
