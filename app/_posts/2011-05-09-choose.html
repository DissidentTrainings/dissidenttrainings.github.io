<p>Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a tribe. Choose a fucking big visions, Choose computers, mobiles, hard drives and internet. Choose to choose, low waste and no insurance that it will work. Choose sprinting. Choose a iteration 0. Choose your colleagues. Choose art and being an artist. Choose to make a difference in a range of fucking projects. Choose DIY and wondering who you are on a Friday evening. Choose not Â sitting on that chair watching mind-numbing sprit- crushing meetings, stuffing fucking boredom in your brain. Choose being still passionate at the end of it all, putting you in the position to disobey to command and control, nothing more than an piece of guidance to the other change agents you have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life... But why wouldn't I want to do a thing like that?</p>
