<p>Following the <a href="http://martinwolf.org/category/weekly-recap/">practice</a> of <a href="http://martinwolf.org/martin-wolf/">Martin Wolf</a>, I am now posting a recap of things I do over the course of a week. So you can see not only what is on my mind, but what I am actually doing</p>
<p><strong>Backbone.js </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>backbone inheritance. Looks easy, but there are quite many ways to do it.<br />
<a href="http://www.erichynds.com/blog/backbone-and-inheritance">"Backbone.js &amp; inherticance"</a> gives you a intro</li>
<li>And if you are looking how to inherit those defaults you might wanna see this<br />
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14614582/backbone-js-model-inheritance">Stackoverflow thread</a></li>
<li>Want to validate backbone models? I seem to come back to<br />
<a href="https://github.com/thedersen/backbone.validation">"backbone.validation"</a> again and again</li>
<li>You might wanna check the common pitfalls early on<br />
"<a href="http://ozkatz.github.io/avoiding-common-backbonejs-pitfalls.html">avoiding common pitfalls</a>"</li>
</ul>
<p>Development</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a big fan of Grunt.js but I must admit: Gulp is awesome. I got really tired of big configuration files that seemed to be a mistery after a while. You might wanna read the<br />
"<a href="https://www.codefellows.org/blog/quick-intro-to-gulp-js">quick intro to gulp.js</a>" and give it a chance. You will not regret it. Lean and Mean I say.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blogposts</p>
<ul>
<li>Olaf Lewitz has a piece on happiness, money and a interview with the CEO of Krankikom GmbH<br />
"<a href="http://trustartist.com/2014/08/29/most-important-things-in-life/">The most important things in life</a>". This was my blogpost of the week.</li>
</ul>
