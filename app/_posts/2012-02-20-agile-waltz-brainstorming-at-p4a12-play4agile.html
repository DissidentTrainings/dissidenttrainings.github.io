<p>While visiting the play4agile conference in Rückersbach, now for the second time in a row, a lot of great feedback was given to me by the participants regarding my journeyman's year project. A lot of different people visit this conference: From agile coaches to project managers to coding craftsmen, all types of Agilists can be found there. It turned out to be a perfect mixture of people helping me with new input on the idea.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>As the initial blog post was made some days before the open space styled conference and my social gap (aka twitter followers) seems to be filled with the people attending, a lot of people seemed to be pretty well informed. Comments went from "Great idea btw." to "I wish I had the courage to do something like this" to "I had thought about a thing like this for a long time" to "Hey, why don't you work for us" and that really helped me realizing that the plan to copy the concept of a waltz and travel for a time to work for minimum cost in exchange for knowhow is not that much of a stupid thing in the eyes of people I would call "peers".</p>
<p>The main themes</p>
<p>After I had used the lightning talk spot for 3 minutes of shameless self marketing I was a approached with lots of ideas , offers, criticism and comments from individuals.  The main points (as far as I remember now).</p>
<ul>
<li>How to finance all this</li>
<li>Who could be a location</li>
<li>Direct offers to work something out</li>
<li>Input on whom I could contact</li>
<li>Input on what I could do</li>
</ul>
<p>The main problem was that not everybody got what I advertised on the lightning talk slot, not everyone had read the blog-posting and this led to a great number of different "one on one" conversations. It turned out that each of these conversations where intense and bought up new points I had not thought about. Additionally I the new generated insights did not get back to the early idea generators. So what to do with this?</p>
<p><strong>The idea wall brainstorming game </strong></p>
<p>On the last evening the personel of the location gave permission to use a big wall-space in the lobby or a little brainstorming gas. Stickynotes and adding pens were placed around it and a little description was given in order to clearly point out what the reason of this game/activity was. Lucky me, the conference was about games and everybody anyway was in "creation mode".</p>
<p>It took some time and some explanations to convince passing conference Participants that adding new ideas was a good thing and from a point things went very del, lots of feedback and ideas was generated. Additionally the conversation went amongst others and not all needed to be triggered by me. As far as I observed, the Quality of the input was getting better from that point on.</p>
<p>So here we go, all the input in unordered form:</p>
