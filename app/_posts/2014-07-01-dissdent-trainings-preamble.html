    is the preamble of the effort to create a company providing trainings for the
    field of software development in the 21st century. The base assumptions we are
    building this company on are outlined in this text and should guide us whenever
    we have questions about the products that @d_trainigs is delivering.\r\n\r\n<b>No
    is the perfect answer</b>\r\n\r\nAgile development started as a countermovement
    to traditional software methods, at least the business thought so. In fact most
    elements in the body of methods we call agile development today are either from
    manufacturing (lean, kanban etc.) or cold war WMD projects (IID - Incremental
    an Iterative Development, today called Scrum). We should not neglect the fact
    that, method-wise, these ways of working have proven to be effective and efficient
    to develop high quality software and products, but when building on the shoulders
    of the pasts giants to remix and craft new methods out of the knowledge of today
    we should be aware that not every aspect of the old is acceptable on an ethics
    level and therefore should be eliminated. Not subscribing to a predefined method
    and re-thinking an own variant on the basis of clear ethical values is always
    and option but requires a clear voiced \"NO, we do not subscribe to this\". We
    shall rise this voice whenever it seems appropriate and work with those who do
    the same. There are many having the same concern but remain silent.\r\n\r\n<b>Memetics,
    Marketing and Creative Commons</b>\r\n\r\nThere is always the question how a organization
    stays visible in a market that is full of contenders and service offers that overlap
    with ours in many ways. There is always the question of how to communicate the
    information that a product exists and that it is what the customer needs. Most
    companies handle the product and it's marketing as different things. This is a
    result of having a price in any case: if you want to buy the training, you have
    to pay for it. In order to communicate the offer to the customer a complete new
    channel has to be opened: marketing. We have observed the rise of Open Source
    Licenses in Software and profited enough from them to have a good idea of how
    these ways of product licensing and pricing have an effect on marketing in order
    to apply the same mechanics to our own product. By publishing all of our Training-materials
    licensed on basis of Creative Commons we achieve a set of things:\r\n<ul>\n<li>The
    material will be copied and changed. Only for this reason it's worth the publication
    with less restrictions. We believe we deliver stuff that adheres to the highest
    standards and it will prevail through spreading and the changes that come with
    it. Commercial use of this material by the \"Copyist\" is not only intended, it
    is encouraged.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is less marketing involved when delivering
    this way. No need to build a big story when you can deliver the product itself
    quasi as marketing material. The product might seem a little less cool when delivered
    without cool storytelling, but we deeply believe that the product stays \"real\"
    and is less full of lies in order to depcept you into a payment</li>\r\n\t<li>Through
    Credit (Part of the license and we will enforce it), there will be always the
    notion that @dtrainings is the original creator and people will assume that @dtraings
    is the best organization to receive these trainings from. Who ever copied the
    trainings and held them for himself, there will be always the attribution to the
    original author(s).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe save on parts of marketing, you have the
    product at your hand early on and even can choose to use another company to deliver
    the training to you. A perfect way for us put stuff out there that sticks and
    has relevancy.\r\n\r\n<b>We are hackers and so we do deliver trainings</b>\r\n\r\nOne
    thing that all hackers have in common is a certain itch to research, creative
    play and a certain fun when it comes to destructive behavior. This is the way
    we want to deliver the trainings for you.\r\n<ul>\n<li>It's the 21st century,
    Baby. It's our intention to adhere to this situation and use many of the new findings
    that come out of research in the fields of arts, humanities technology and psychology.</li>\r\n\t<li>Some
    things need to be handled in a playful way because there is no fixed outcome we
    can plan. It's important to be honest about that and then to play it out. We deeply
    believe this is the way to create novel things.</li>\r\n\t<li>All methods have
    failures, and if it's only the failure to admit that fact, but in the end: everything
    has errors and mistakes and we should be encouraged to find them and publicly
    state so. Worst case is always that a erroneous method stays in use. Sometimes
    do things need to be destroyed in order to make place for the new, better things
    with less flaws.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<b>TL;TR</b>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Always think and re-think
    the status quo - This requires a firm NO</li>\r\n\t<li>Free, high quality stuff
    beats any marketing budget</li>\r\n\t<li>We do trainings like hackers because
    we are a result of that culture.</li>\r\n</ul>\n</div>\";}"

<p>This was written a while ago. It proved valid as a guiding document in how to organize self-employed work by providing a manifesto instead of "hard rules". So if you want to know, why I changed my Bio status to "Funder/Trainer" instead of "Looking for a Job" (No that I don't, but I am not the kind of guy to sit tight and wait - So why not create a well crafted business here):</p>
<p>This might be the first post of a few that try to explain this move, it's implications and the funny stories alongside. </p>
<p>Btw: The thing has a name: Dissident Trainings and a github account</p>
