<p>Michael McCollough and Don McGreal ran a valuable workshop on how to create your own game. Mike and Don have been creating simple, fun games for years and have noticed an approach they follow. See TastyCupcakes for lots of great games. As a caveat, they outline one particular style of game development â€“ simple games. This is in contrast with complex games such as XPGame and Business Value Game (which are favourites of mine)</p>
