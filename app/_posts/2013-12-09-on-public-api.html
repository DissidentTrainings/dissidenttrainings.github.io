<p>There are some things that I would expect from a public api to use it in a project</p>
<ul>
<li>A good API - What ever you think that is: give it to me, please</li>
<li>Someone "in charge" of the code - person will do, a group is better</li>
<li>A github, gitlab or bitbucket url - Source-Code or die()</li>
<li>A set of tests</li>
<li>A way to 'build' the module</li>
<li>The Unit is in CI and I can see the results - travis &lt;3</li>
<li>installation via a package manger - npm, gem, composer, bower</li>
<li>Markdown Docs</li>
<li>Source-Code API Docs - Build of these included please</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
