<p>Here’s to the crazy ones.<br />
The misfits.<br />
The rebels.<br />
The troublemakers.</p>
<p>The round pegs in the square holes.<br />
The ones who see things differently.<br />
They’re not fond of rules.<br />
And they have no respect for the status quo.<br />
You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.<br />
About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.<br />
Because they change things.<br />
They push the human race forward.<br />
And while some may see them as the crazy ones,<br />
We see genius.<br />
Because the people who are crazy enough to think<br />
they can change the world,<br />
Are the ones who do.</p>
