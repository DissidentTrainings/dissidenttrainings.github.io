<p>Adding to the great feedback that was communicated over twitter by everybody participating some ideas came to my mind to improve it. I promised to write them down. So here they are.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visibillity</strong><br />
All the elements of a unconference should be easily accessible and visible to everybody taking part. So if the uncon is a part of a conference, right in the middle of everything. So the absence of nice company booths at dpcon (a great thing in my eyes) provides a lot of space, that was unused but in general visited by everybody. Another thing is the track planning, which could have been a wall with big, clear written Notes (A4 size).<br />
Another thing regarding visibillity is the planning and the exercise of the rituals. For not so morning persons a public mid-day standup would be a great thing to catch up with latest developments. If commencing this in public space, the other conference guests would see all that by accident, and latest on ending of day 1 everybody would have a little exercise with the things someone needs to do to participate.</li>
<li><strong>Main Format Openspace</strong><br />
I suspect in cases of subconferences the format of straight organizing one track is not 100% perfect. Conferences open a lot of space which could be used for open space like events. Openspace is a little different and requires more effort in terms of materials and number of hosting people that are exercising the elements. On the other hand it creates a atmosphere of a ongoing event. A simple Open Space could keep 20-50 People engaged all the time.</li>
<li><strong>One to One</strong><br />
On the scrum gathering was a as the expert list where experts of a certain area would make appointments. So for example a very detailed question about drupal could be discussed in detail. Some of those appointments had more than 2 persons in it. The list is public and person asking and the person consulting may only meet for the  session (Timeboxed 15-30 Minutes).</li>
<li><strong>Coding Dojo</strong><br />
Maybe 2 or 3 people a day could hold a coding dojo a day (one codes and everybody can interact). Naturally you need a workshop room for that. Kind of a uncon sidetrack that could run along.</li>
<li><strong>Instant Feedback</strong><br />
Maybe I am a "spoiled agile brat", but dude where is my paper wall to stick nice feedback notes on? Joind in is ok for normal conference tracks, but for a unconference, by definition a evolving event, rating stuff 2 days later is too late.</li>
</ul>
<p>A greater focus on unconference styled contents is a great thing. This is simply the f<strong>uture of tech conferences</strong>. I find the idea of paying money to go to a conference only to consume information in general not appealing so this is stuff for me. The more interaction and involvement is possible the better.</p>
